/* 
- create a function called bowlingAverage
- the function shall accept a single parameter (which will be an array)
- the function should return the average score based on the size of the array that gets supplied to the function.

Special Notes: use a FOR OF LOOP

example: let bowler1 = bowlingAverage([150, 212, 153])
         console.log(bowler1)

*/

/* 
let bowler1Scores = [150,212,153]
let bowler2Scores = [250,232,198]

write a function that will take two different arrays as parameters.
inside the function have for loop that will combine the two bowlers scores into a combined array

example output: [400, 444, 351 ]
